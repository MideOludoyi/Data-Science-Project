## Introduction

The Pavement Distress Predictive Tool is aimed at providing an accurate prediction of Pavement Condition Index (PCI) based on various distress features such as area, length, severity, and distress density. This tool leverages a machine learning model to assist in pavement maintenance and planning.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Handles raw data input, cleansing, and preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts and transforms features necessary for model training.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model to predict PCI.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots to visualize the performance of the model.

## Requirements

To run the predictive tool, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.8 or later
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
